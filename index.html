     <h3> This movie is probably every 2000's baby's childhood. I grew up watching this and whatched this about 20 times and still have no ide what happens in the suspence. This movie is a fun movie and has a very exciting storyline. It is a top in my highly recomended list because it has so many lively characters and is about a girl (rupunzel) who dosent know she is royalty and is stuck in a tower with her only dream which is to she the lanterns which coincidentally are always let go on her birthday until a dude with his own problems, sumbles across rupnzel and her tower and they set on an advnntourous journy to escape both thier problems. </h3>

      <h3>  This movie is very aspiring, emotional, and quite the comedy. I think the movie was exciquted amazingly and had such beautiful charactars and art. This movie had a sort of a fantasy but historic hint to it. Overall, you can tell I'm a geek for disney and i absoultly love everything about disney and will recomend every single disney movie (even if I havent watched it!)  </h3>
